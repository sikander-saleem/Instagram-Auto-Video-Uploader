   Modify the file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add the details according to yours:

   ```env
   INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
   INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password
   VIDEO_PATH=video.mov
   VIDEO_CAPTION=#anime #manga
   RESTART_TIMER=300  # Restart timer in seconds (5 minutes)
   ```

4. **Run the script**:
   Execute the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ‚è≥ Usage
- The script will log into your Instagram account, upload the specified video, and clean up the directory after each upload attempt.

- After a successful upload, the script will wait for the defined restart timer before restarting.

## üìñ Important Notes
- Ensure that your Instagram account is configured to allow uploads via third-party applications.
- The `VIDEO_PATH` should point to a valid video file located in the same directory as the script.
